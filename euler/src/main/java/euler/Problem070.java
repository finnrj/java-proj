 <p>Euler's Totient function, φ(<var>n</var>) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to <var>n</var> which are relatively prime to <var>n</var>. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.<br>The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1)=1. </p> 
 <p>Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.</p> 
 <p>Find the value of <var>n</var>, 1 &lt; <var>n</var> &lt; 10<sup>7</sup>, for which φ(<var>n</var>) is a permutation of <var>n</var> and the ratio <var>n</var>/φ(<var>n</var>) produces a minimum.</p>
